# Image Assets for Card Ordering Game

This directory contains the image assets for the different card decks used in the game. Here's the expected structure:

## Directory Structure

```
assets/
├── basic/       # Basic cards (img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.)
├── geography/   # Geography cards (mountain.jpg, erosion.jpg, etc.)
└── history/     # History cards (ancient.jpg, medieval.jpg, etc.)
```

## Adding Images

Place appropriate images in each folder matching the filenames referenced in the JSON deck files.

For example, if your deck JSON references `assets/basic/img1.jpg`, make sure to place an `img1.jpg` file in the `assets/basic/` directory.

## Placeholder Images

Until you add real images, you can create placeholder images with text labels. Each image should have a 4:3 aspect ratio for best display (recommended size: 400x300 pixels).
