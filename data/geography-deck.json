This process can create towering peaks like Mount Everest, which continues to grow taller each year as the plates keep pushing against each other.", "order": 1 },

Over time, water carves paths through even the hardest stone, creating new landforms. The Grand Canyon formed this way as the Colorado River cut through rock layers over millions of years.", "order": 2 },

U-shaped valleys were carved by glaciers, while V-shaped valleys were created by rivers. Valleys often have fertile soil from minerals deposited by water, making them good for farming.", "order": 3 },

The deeper the canyon, the older the exposed rock at the bottom. Some canyons, like Copper Canyon in Mexico, are so large they have their own unique ecosystems at different depths.", "order": 4 }
